# Conway's Game Of Life
I was following a course to review my Java skills and implement Mathematician James Conway's Game Of Life using Java Swing.

## Controls

* Spacebar
  * Holding the Spacebar down runs the entire game of life through successive generations
  * Tapping the Spacebar steps through one generation only
  
* Enter
  * Tapping the Enter key randomizes the grid and adds more live cells on the grid, which are the green cells

* Backspace
  * Deletes the entire current grid to restart the game or to generate different playthroughs

* Left Mouse Button
  * Adds/removes an individual live cell on the grid somewhere
